    <h1>My First HTML Thing</h1>
    <h2>This is the second header</h2>
    <h3>This is the third header</h3>
    <h4>This is the fourth header</h4>
    <h5>Do I need to have a line of space between each header?</h5>
    <div>
        This is the first div 
        <div>
            This is the second div
            <div>
                But wait there's more! Last div.
            </div>
            <div>
                This is a sibling div. 
            </div>
        </div>

    This exercise is about making lists 
    <!-- is this div doing anything? -->
        <div>
            Here's what I like about lists:
            <ul>
                <li>They're useful</li>
                <li>That'a about it</li>
                <li>I am going to put another list item here because doing things is cool</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    
    When you make a list, do it in this order:
    <ol>
        <li>Decide if it's an ordered list or not</li>
        <li>If it's not an ordered list, use the ul tag, otherwise use the ol tag<ul>
            <li>Use li tags nested int he list for your list items
                <ol>
                    <li>Curveball! You can nest lists inside each other</li>
                </ol></li></ul></li>
        <li>You've got this, I believe in you!</li>
    </ol>

    Here's a couple ways you can express yourself:
