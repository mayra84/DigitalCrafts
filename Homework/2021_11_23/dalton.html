        <p>November 22, 2016. The day my life changed forever. The first time I saw Dalton, he was trying to cross a busy street with surprising calmness. I went to the parking lot in efforts to find the stray puppy and offer him some food. He trusted me with such ease one would think he had never been wronged before, but the scars on his body told a different story. I took him home that day and and have never regretted it, even when he chewed up my favorite shoes.
