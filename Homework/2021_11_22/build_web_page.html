            <h2>Brief Bio</h2>
            <p>
            Taylor Alison Swift was born on December 13, 1989. No, I did not refer to Wikipedia for that information, every self-proclaimed Swiftie knows this all like the back of their hand.
            </p>
            <p>
            Her family moved to Nashville, Tennessee to help 12-year-old Taylor pursue her dreams.
